We introduce a novel model fusion technique, **BOMF**, that optimizes both the desired metric and loss via multi-objective Bayesian optimization, guided by a two-stage hyperparameter search. Experiments across diverse downstream tasks demonstrate performance improvements when combining fine-tuned models under this framework. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}
