Dimension Agnostic Neural Processes (DANP) introduces a new meta-learning framework that can handle diverse input and output dimensions via a Dimension Aggregator Block, transforming features into fixed-dimensional representations. Extensive experiments on synthetic regression tasks, image/video completion, and Bayesian optimization show that DANP outperforms previous Neural Process variants. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}
